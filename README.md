## My process

I first created the html portion and then styled it using CSS with flexbox.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that it takes a few trials of settings to use to get the exact dimensions as the sample. The page I made is still not 100% exactly the same dimensions but I can say that it's only a minor difference.


### Continued development

I'm not 100% sure that this is the best way to do this or it can be refactored more to make the code more efficient.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This article helped me a lot with flexbox.
